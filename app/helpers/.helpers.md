### Helper Files

Helpers are Functions that when loaded, are available throughout the entire project and may be used whenever the developer wants.
Helper files must only define Helper functions. You must name your helpers with '.helper.php' after your helper's name. 

i.e. 'file.helper.php'
Then this helper may be loaded using \XyLex\Helper::Load('file');
