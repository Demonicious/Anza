### Library Files

Libraries are Classes that don't need to rely on any Drivers for their functionality. Library classes can Load Config files as per need.
They can also load Models however It's not recommended behavior.

\Anza\Libraries::Load('LibraryName') can be used to load the library class into the context. However you will need to instantiate it yourself before use.
